# Reporting Security Issues

The CZI team and community take security bugs in czLandscapingTk seriously. 
We appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose your findings, 
and will make every effort to acknowledge your contributions. 

To report a security issue, email security@chanzuckerberg.com and include the word "SECURITY" 
in the subject line.

The CZI team will send a response indicating the next steps in handling your report. 
After the initial reply to your report, the security team will keep you informed of the 
progress towards a fix and full announcement, and may ask for additional information or guidance.

The CZLandscaping toolkit is intended as research-level code to enable landscaping analysis 
over extant scientific knowledge in the wider community.
